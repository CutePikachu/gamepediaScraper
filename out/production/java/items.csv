"Apple","Apples are a common Food that can be eaten either raw, Roasted, or in a Stew. When chopped, one apple produces four apple slices.

It is important to note, that the apple ``must`` be sliced. A full apple does not satisfy as much hunger as four slices, despite the rational assumption that it would.","/Users/tina/learning/java/src/images/Apple.png"
